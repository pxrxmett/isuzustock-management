## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Exposed Credentials Rotation Required

### Background
This codebase previously contained hardcoded credentials in version control. These credentials have been removed, but if they were production keys, they **must be rotated immediately**.

### Action Items

#### 1. LINE API Credentials
If the following credentials were production keys:
- `LINE_CHANNEL_ID: 2006746784`
- `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET: e673f3def0fecc4eeb43aad4460381fa`
- `LINE_LIFF_ID: 2006746784-e1y9NRqn`

**Actions Required:**
1. Go to [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/)
2. Navigate to your channel settings
3. **Rotate the Channel Secret immediately**
4. Update all deployed applications with the new credentials
5. Update your `.env` file with the new credentials

#### 2. Database Credentials
The following database credentials were previously hardcoded:
- Host: `mysql.railway.internal`
- Username: `root`
- Password: `yowDL0snjFWZrTDPvTJgvhjnqNeNUIUZ`
- Database: `railway`

**Actions Required:**
1. Change the database password in Railway dashboard
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in Railway
3. Redeploy the application

#### 3. JWT Secret
**Actions Required:**
1. Generate a strong JWT secret:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```
2. Set the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable
3. Restart the application

### Default Admin Account

A default admin account is created during database migration:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Email:** `admin@isuzustock.com`
- **Password:** `Admin@123456`

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Change this password immediately after first login!**

### Environment Variables Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in all required values in `.env`

3. **Never commit `.env` file to version control**

### Security Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ All credentials are now stored in environment variables
2. ‚úÖ Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (10 rounds)
3. ‚úÖ Database connection fails fast if credentials are missing
4. ‚úÖ JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
5. ‚úÖ User status is checked on every login

### Reporting Security Issues
